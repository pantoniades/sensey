Sensey (sense-ee) is designed to run on various raspberry pis (currently) to read from various environment sensors and track the output on a web server (also on a Pi). 
I use it to montor my plants and rooms for temperature, light and humidity with several pi zero 2s and run the server on a Pi 5 (that also runs the client).
