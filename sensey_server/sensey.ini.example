# Sensey Server Configuration
# Copy this file to sensey.ini and configure for your environment

[server]
# TODO: This section should be expanded to include global server settings
# Future: port, host, debug mode, logging level, etc.

# System-wide unit preference for all sensors
# metric: °C, hPa, m/s, mm
# imperial: °F, inHg, mph, inches
# Note: Existing sensors (garden, sensehat) use metric
system_units = metric

[storage]
# TODO: Data model needs refactoring
# Currently MySQL uses hybrid schema (temp/humidity columns + JSON)
# Should move to single unified table with consistent schema across backends
# Consider: all sensors in JSON, or normalized sensor_readings table
# Storage backend type: csv or mysql
# csv: Simple file-based storage (no additional dependencies)
# mysql: Database storage (requires mysql-connector-python and MySQL 8.4+)
backend = csv

[csv]
# Directory for storing CSV data files
# Can be relative (to sensey_server directory) or absolute path
data_dir = data

[mysql]
# MySQL 8.4+ connection parameters (only used if backend=mysql)
# The server uses a hybrid schema:
#   - temperature and humidity stored as dedicated columns (fast queries)
#   - other measurements stored in JSON column (flexible schema)

# Connection pool size (number of persistent connections)
# Adjust based on expected concurrent client connections

[ecowitt]
# Ecowitt weather station integration (GW3000, GW1000, etc.)
# Enable to receive data from Ecowitt devices via Custom Server feature

# Enable/disable Ecowitt integration
enabled = false

# URL endpoint for receiving Ecowitt data (without leading slash)
# Configure your GW3000 Custom Server to: http://your-server:5000/ecowitt

# Client name that appears in the dashboard
# If not specified, uses device PASSKEY as identifier
# Examples: backyard-weather, weather-station, ecowitt-gw3000
client_name = ecowitt-weather

# TODO: Support multiple devices with PASSKEY mapping
# passkey_map = {"ABC123": "backyard", "DEF456": "frontyard"}
