# csv: Simple file-based storage (no additional dependencies)
# mysql: Database storage (requires mysql-connector-python and MySQL 8.4+)

# The server uses a hybrid schema:
#   - temperature and humidity stored as dedicated columns (fast queries)
#   - other measurements stored in JSON column (flexible schema)
